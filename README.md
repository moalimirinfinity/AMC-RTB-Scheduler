# AMC-RTB Scheduler — Analysis & Simulation


---

## Overview

This repository implements a complete workflow for the AMC-RTB (Adaptive Mixed-Criticality — Response Time Bound) scheduler assignment in an embedded systems course.  
It is designed to be reproducible and automated: starting from execution-time measurement (MiBench), producing WCET statistics, synthesising a mixed-criticality periodic task set, carrying out theoretical response-time analysis, and running discrete-event simulations for LO and HI modes.
